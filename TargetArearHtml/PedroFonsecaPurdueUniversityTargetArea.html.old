<h3>Research</h3>
<p>

My research focuses on <b> building systems </b> that are both reliable and secure.
In particular, during the last years, I have developed techniques and methodologies
that are particularly suited to address this problem in the context of core software systems
â€“ the building blocks in modern computing
that other software layers critically rely upon, such as <b>operating systems</b>,
<b>hypervisors</b> and <b>distributed systems</b>. 

</p>
I tackle this problem from three directions:
<ul>
<li>	Gathering insights about the impact of emerging trends on reliability 
			and security, by conducting real-world, empirical studies
	</li>
<li>	Building systematic testing tools that scale to modern, complex systems
	</li>
<li>	Designing and redesigning systems for reliability and security
	</li>
</ul>
